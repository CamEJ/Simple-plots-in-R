# 1 Bar plot without error bars

library(ggplot2)

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x=OTU, y=LDA, fill=Growth), show_guide=FALSE) +
# data is the name of your data frame, 
# put name of column containing the categorical data you want on x axis
# after aes(x=
# put name of column containing the variable y axis
# after aes(y=
# after fill = put the name of the column containing the variable by which you want your bars coloured

geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") # this arguments tells ggplot you want a bar plot
#  position_dodge is for creating side-by-side barcharts
# stat=identitiy tell it you want the height of the bar to be what you defined as your y axis. 

# coord_flip() # add this argument at end if you want a horizontal as opposed to vertical bar plot to flip it 90 deg

## Now to add error bars. 
# you need to add geom_errorbar() argument where you define your max and min
# for error bars which are y axis variable + error and yaxis variable - error
# So if the name of your Y axis column is named 'LDA ' (as in this example)
and the name of your column with standard deviation in
is called 'sd' then is would be:
geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=LDA-se, ymax=LDA+se))


## So in total,something like this

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x=OTU, y=LDA, fill=Growth), show_guide=FALSE) +
geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity") +
geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=LDA-se, ymax=LDA+se), width=.1) + # add error bars (width argument changes thickness or error bar lines)
coord_flip() # flip it 90

plot # print and see.
